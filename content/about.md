I am a political science professor at [**Davidson College**](http://davidson.edu/). My current teaching and research interests focus on data and visualizations in politics and broader society.  Previously, I held administrative roles at Davidson, most recently Vice President for Strategic Partnerships. In this administrative work, I helped lead Davidson's partnership with edX and worked with campus constituencies to expand the use of data analytics in decision making. I also led Davidson's 10th-year reaffirmation of SACSCOC reaccreditation in 2017. I came to Davidson in 2000 to teach in the political science department.  I have published numerous articles in leading journals of political science, as well as an award-winning book [**Cycles of Spin**](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/cycles-spin-strategic-communication-us-congress?format=HB).
