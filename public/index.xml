      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I am a political science professor at Davidson College. My current teaching and research interests focus on data and visualizations in politics and broader society. Previously, I held administrative roles at Davidson, most recently Vice President for Strategic Partnerships. In this administrative work, I helped lead Davidson&amp;rsquo;s partnership with edX and worked with campus constituencies to expand the use of data analytics in decision making. I also led Davidson&amp;rsquo;s 10th-year reaffirmation of SACSCOC reaccreditation in 2017.</description>
